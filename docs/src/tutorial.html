                Getting started
            </h2>

                <h1>Getting started</h1>
                <p>Each presentation is called a <em>deck</em>. Get going by
                clicking New Deck.  From here you must choose a location and
                name for your new deck.</p>

                <p>Whiteboard is only controlled by the application menu, and
                additionally the context menu (<em>Right click</em> or
                <em>&#8984; + Click</em>).</p>

                <p>Using the menu, or <code>F2</code>, you can create, edit,
                delete, and re-arrange slides. Create a slide for each activity
                you want to demo, and add an editor, terminal, markdown text,
                or browser as appropriate for each slide. When you are done, be
                sure to save from the <code>File</code> menu.</p>

                <h1>The Whiteboard file format</h1>
                <p>The decks are stored in a plaintext format that
                resembles INI files, with the extension `.whiteboard`.
                The format is simple and convenient enough to edit by
                hand. Example file:</p>

<pre>
[slide]
title=POST request demonstration
terminal=./POST_python/
editor=./POST_python/*.py

[slide]
title=Demo of final app
browser = ./POST_challenge/index.html
markdown : '''
# Recreate the browser
- Try to recreate this app using Flask
- Hint: You'll have to use a POST endpoint
